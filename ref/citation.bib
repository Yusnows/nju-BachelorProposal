	abstract="Several 3D reconstruction techniques deriving from stereoradiographic DLT have been presented during the last 15 years, but these techniques have usually been limited in accuracy because of the small number of corresponding anatomical landmarks identified on both radiographs. A new technique has recently been proposed to perform 3D reconstruction of the spine using not only the stereo-corresponding anatomical landmarks (seen on both frontal and sagittal X-ray films) but also some non-stereo-corresponding ones. This technique (called non-stereo-corresponding points or NSCP) has already been used for cervical dry vertebrae. In the present study, we focus on the validation of this technique for lumbar vertebrae by comparing four techniques: direct measurement, CT scan, 3D reconstruction by stereoradiography using a direct linear transformation (DLT) algorithm and the NSCP technique. The accuracy of the NSCP technique was also evaluated on different vertebral regions. The global results show mean errors of 1.1 mm and maximum of 7.8 mm with regard to direct measurements. These mean errors are close to those obtained using 3D reconstructions from CT scan using 1 mm cuts.",

These methods are based on the identification of anatomical structures in several views which are obtained by rotation of a patient standing on a turntable. Calibration algorithms for computer vision or photogrammetry are well documented, but they generally yield calibration devices which are cumbersome for the use in clinical stereoradiography. This paper presents a calibration method adapted to a two-view stereoradiography calibration (frontal and lateral incidences) and based on a simplified geometric modeling of the radiological environment. The a priori knowledge yields four calibration equations related to the vertical and horizontal planes of both views, leading to a specific calibration procedure and device. Moreover this device is attached to the stereoradiographic system (directly integrated on the turntable) in order to facilitate clinical applications. A validation was performed on 26 dried lumbar vertebrae in order to evaluate clinical situation. The mean accuracy of the stereoradiographic reconstruction was 1.2mm."

The proposed technique enables the 3D reconstruction of additional landmarks that can be identified in only one of the radiographs. The principle of this method is the deformation of an elastic object that respects stereocorresponding and non-stereo-corresponding observations available in different projections. This technique is based on the principle that any non-stereocorresponding point belongs to a line joining the X-ray source and the projection of the point in one view. The aim is to determine the 3D position of these points on their line of projection when submitted to geometrical and topological constraints. This technique is used to obtain the 3D geometry of 18 cadaveric upper cervical vertebrae. The reconstructed geometry obtained is compared with direct measurements using a magnetic digitiser. The order of precision determined with the point-to-surface distance between the reconstruction obtained with that technique and reference measurements is about 1 mm, depending on the vertebrae studied. Comparison results indicate that the obtained reconstruction is close to the actual vertebral geometry. This method can therefore be proposed to obtain the 3D geometry of vertebrae.",

The present investigation was limited to stereoradiographic setups with a normal vertical stereo base. Possible X-ray tube positions are thus corresponding to angles ranging from 0 (conventional posteroanterior radiograph) up to 30° (dimension of the X-ray room). An X-ray phantom was used as a specimen from which three-dimensional reconstructions with the direct linear transformation (DLT) algorithm were obtained. Visibility of landmarks located on pedicles, end-plates, transverse and spinous processes was evaluated for the whole thoracic and lumbar spine (T1 to L5). Process landmarks were discarded because their poor visibility on radiographs produced inaccurate three-dimensional reconstructions. Considering the size, shape and orientation of vertebrae, an angle of 20° between the posteroanterior horizontal position and the angled position of the X-ray tube gave optimal results. Landmarks located on pedicles and end-plates produced the most reliable three-dimensional reconstructions of the spine. Pedicles were found to be more reliable landmarks than end-plates. Validation of the technique with reconstructed steel beads reveals three-dimensional errors under 1.0 mm. Since vertebral landmarks were more difficult to identify on radiographs than steel beads, reconstruction results were compared with those obtained with a biplanar orthogonal setup. This shows that three-dimensional errors of 8.0 mm may be expected on actual reconstructions of the spine and errors as large as 15.0 mm may be present on poorly visible landmarks."

The dual kriging technique presented here simplifies considerably the handling of interpolated data and is especially useful for 3-D applications. It also containsspline interpolation as a particular case and theleast squares method as a limit case. In order to minimize the computational effort, several original features have been incorporated in this program: (1) the concept ofdistance of influence was introduced to allow the algorithm, when evaluating the interpolation value at a given location, to discard data points that are situated too far apart; (2)arbitrary geometric domains are decomposed into simpler regions, inside which the requested contours are drawn directly by scanning vertical slices from left to right, instead of building each contour line sequentially as in direct contouring; (3) contour lines may also be stored in arandom access database (this last feature was added to enable the automatic assembly of isovalue surfaces in 3-D applications such as stress analysis); and (4) contours can be smoothed by interpolating separately the sequences ofX andY coordinates for each contour line. This process, calledparametric kriging, permits the efficient compression of the number of data points necessary to record contours.",

Stereoradiographic methods based on anatomical landmarks identification are the only ones providing information on 3D-deformities of the spine in a standing position, but require 2–4 h for the whole spine, making the method inadequate for clinical routine. Methods. The proposed semi-automated method is based on (1) vertebral body volume reconstruction, (2) definition of a local referential associated to this volume, (3) reliable a priori knowledge of the vertebral shape using eight morphologic descriptors of the vertebral body to estimate, from a multiple linear regression, 21 3D-point coordinates per vertebra, (4) kriging of a 2000 points model with regard to the 21 points. The method was evaluated for vertebral orientation and shape accuracy. Results. 3D models of the whole spine are obtained within 15 min. Manual vs. semi-automated reconstruction comparison yield similar accuracy regarding the CT-scan references. For vertebrae orientation, results were slightly different from the manual reconstruction method (however an absolute reference is lacking). Conclusion. The stereoradiographic 3D-reconstruction method allows for a significant reduction of the whole reconstruction time, with regard to previously described methods. Moreover, the accuracy was evaluated and was found to be comparable to the accuracy of previous methods. The results of this study show that stereoradiography could now be employed in routine clinical environment.Relevance 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs in standing position can be obtained using a fast and accurate method."

	abstract = "Current trends in spine research are reviewed in order to suggest future opportunities for biomechanics. Recent studies show that psychosocial factors influence back pain behaviour but are not important causes of pain itself. Severe back pain most often arises from intervertebral discs, apophyseal joints and sacroiliac joints, and physical disruption of these structures is strongly but variably linked to pain. Typical forms of structural disruption can be reproduced by severe mechanical loading in-vitro, with genetic and age-related weakening sometimes leading to injury under moderate loading. Biomechanics can be used to quantify spinal loading and movements, to analyse load distributions and injury mechanisms, and to develop therapeutic interventions. The authors suggest that techniques for quantifying spinal loading should be capable of measurement “in the field” so that they can be used in epidemiological surveys and ergonomic interventions. Great accuracy is not required for this task, because injury risk depends on tissue weakness as much as peak loading. Biomechanical tissue testing and finite-element modelling should complement each other, with experiments establishing proof of concept, and models supplying detail and optimising designs. Suggested priority areas for future research include: understanding interactions between intervertebral discs and adjacent vertebrae; developing prosthetic and tissue-engineered discs; and quantifying spinal function during rehabilitation. “Mechanobiology” has perhaps the greatest future potential, because spinal degeneration and healing are both mediated by the activity of cells which are acutely sensitive to their local mechanical environment. Precise characterisation and manipulation of this environment will be a major challenge for spine biomechanics."

It is shown that: (1) an adequate representation of disc behavior requires the inclusion of material anisotropy; (2) material properties of the annulus obtained by direct measurement underestimate the stiffness of the material; (3) reasonable predictions of variations of disc stiffness with vertebral level can be made on the basis of geometry; and (4) degenerative changes associated with loss of elasticity have little effect on the intradiscal pressure, while annular tears result in reduced pressure in agreement with clinical observations."

	abstract="Over the last century the neurocentral junction (NCJ) has been identified as a potential cause of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Disparate growth at this site has been thought to lead to pedicle asymmetry, which then causes vertebral rotation and ultimately, the development of scoliotic curves. The objectives of this study are (1) to incorporate pedicle growth and growth modulation into an existing finite element model of the thoracic and lumbar spine already integrating vertebral body growth and growth modulation; (2) to use the model to investigate whether pedicle asymmetry, either alone or combined with other deformations, could be involved in scoliosis pathomechanisms. The model was personalized to the geometry of a nonpathological subject and used as the reference spinal configuration. Asymmetry of pedicle geometry (i.e. initial length) and asymmetry of the pedicle growth rate alone or in combination with other AIS potential pathogenesis (anterior, lateral, or rotational displacement of apical vertebra) were simulated over a period of 24 months. The Cobb angle and local scoliotic descriptors (wedging angle, axial rotation) were assessed at each monthly growth cycle. Simulations with asymmetrical pedicle geometry did not produce significant scoliosis, vertebral rotation, or wedging. Simulations with asymmetry of pedicle growth rate did not cause scoliosis independently and did not amplify the scoliotic deformity caused by other deformations tested in the previous model. The results of this model do not support the hypothesis that asymmetrical NCJ growth is a cause of AIS. This concurs with recent animal experiments in which NCJ growth was unilaterally restricted and no scoliosis, vertebral wedging, or rotation was noted.",

	abstract = "Mostly simplified loads were used in biomechanical finite element (FE) studies of the spine because of a lack of data on muscular physiological loading. Inverse static (IS) models allow the prediction of muscle forces for predefined postures. A combination of both mechanical approaches – FE and IS – appears to allow a more realistic modeling. However, it is unknown what deviations are to be expected when muscle forces calculated for models with rigid vertebrae and fixed centers of rotation, as generally found in IS models, are applied to a FE model with elastic vertebrae and discs. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of these disagreements. Muscle forces were estimated for 20° flexion and 10° extension in an IS model and transferred to a FE model. The effects of the elasticity of bony structures (rigid vs. elastic) and the definition of the center of rotation (fixed vs. non-fixed) were quantified using the deviation of actual intervertebral rotation (IVR) of the FE model and the targeted IVR from the IS model. For extension, the elasticity of the vertebrae had only a minor effect on IVRs, whereas a non-fixed center of rotation increased the IVR deviation on average by 0.5° per segment. For flexion, a combination of the two parameters increased IVR deviation on average by 1° per segment. When loading FE models with predicted muscle forces from IS analyses, the main limitations in the IS model – rigidity of the segments and the fixed centers of rotation – must be considered."

	Objectives
	To propose a method to evaluate, from a clinical standpoint, the ability of a finite-element model (FEM) of the trunk to simulate orthotic correction of spinal deformity and to apply it to validate a previously described FEM.
	Summary of background data
	Several FEMs of the scoliotic spine have been described in the literature. These models can prove useful in understanding the mechanisms of scoliosis progression and in optimizing its treatment, but their validation has often been lacking or incomplete.
	Methods
	Three-dimensional (3D) geometries of 10 patients before and during conservative treatment were reconstructed from biplanar radiographs. The effect of bracing was simulated by modeling displacements induced by the brace pads. Simulated clinical indices (Cobb angle, T1–T12 and T4–T12 kyphosis, L1–L5 lordosis, apical vertebral rotation, torsion, rib hump) and vertebral orientations and positions were compared to those measured in the patients' 3D geometries.
	Results
	Errors in clinical indices were of the same order of magnitude as the uncertainties due to 3D reconstruction; for instance, Cobb angle was simulated with a root mean square error of 5.7°, and rib hump error was 5.6°. Vertebral orientation was simulated with a root mean square error of 4.8° and vertebral position with an error of 2.5 mm.
	Conclusions
	The methodology proposed here allowed in-depth evaluation of subject-specific simulations, confirming that FEMs of the trunk have the potential to accurately simulate brace action. These promising results provide a basis for ongoing 3D model development, toward the design of more efficient orthoses."
